      <p class="govuk-body">Giving evidence as a witness can be daunting and the court process can be complicated and difficult to understand.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The Citizens Advice Witness Service provides free and independent  support for both prosecution and defence witnesses in every criminal  court in England and Wales.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Their trained volunteers provide practical information about the court  process. They can also give emotional support to help witnesses feel  more confident when giving evidence.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">They can:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>provide information about the court process</li>
        <li>show witnesses the courtroom before the trial</li>
        <li>be there to talk to in confidence</li>
        <li>accompany witnesses when they give their evidence</li>
        <li>give support on the day of the trial - at verdict and sentencing</li>
        <li>help prepare witnesses who need extra support - at their home or another safe place</li>
        <li>help witnesses claim expenses</li>
        <li>work with other agencies to make sure the right support is provided</li>
        <li>refer witnesses to partner organisations - including local Citizens  Advice, for support with other issues before, during or after the trial</li>
      </ul>
