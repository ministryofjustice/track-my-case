      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Get support giving evidence as a witness</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can get free support and advice on giving evidence from Witness Service, run by Citizens Advice.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can use Witness Service</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">The service can help you if you are a prosecution or defence witness in any criminal court case in England and Wales.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What they can do to help you</h3>
      <p>You will be put in touch with a trained Witness Service volunteer. They can give you practical information about the court process, for example:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>show you the courtroom before the trial</li>
        <li>help you with claiming expenses you might be entitled to</li>
        <li>refer you to other organisations that could support you</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They can also give you emotional support, for example:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>help you feel more confident when giving evidence</li>
        <li>be there to talk to in confidence</li>
        <li>come to court with you when you give your evidence</li>
        <li>be with you on the day of the trial</li>
        <li>help you with any extra support needs at home&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">The volunteers remain impartial to the court case – they do not take sides.</p>
